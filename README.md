Everything you need to know about Blinks and Actions on Solana

## Setup
We're using [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) instead of NPM/Yarn. Make sure it's installed.

Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
cd example
bun install
```

## Usage
```bash
cd example
bun run dev
```

Edit the `server.js` file to change the behavior of the Blink.
